  <!-- 
    You are given a function, Pokeman, that takes three parameters,
    pokemonName, pokemonType, an array of different pokemon attack methods, pokemonAttackList.
      1. Create three instances of the Pokemon and save them in a variable.
      
      2. Using prototype properties, add the following methods:
      • A method called callPokemon that will print the following: “I choose
      you, <pokemon name>
      
        • A method called attack that takes one parameter, an attack number,
      that will print the specific attack method from the pokemonAttackList
      array as the following: “<pokemon name> used <attack method>”
      Call each pokemon with the 2 methods you created.
   -->
